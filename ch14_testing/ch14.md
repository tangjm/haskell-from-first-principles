# Testing

Hspec is a package for unit testing, like the Jasmine and Jest test libraries for Javascript.

QuickCheck is a package for testing properties. 

Arbitrary typeclass defines an arbitrary value with the following type signature:

```haskell
arbitrary :: Arbitrary a => Gen a
```

It can be used to pseudorandomly generate values of type `a`, where `a`.

When used along with functions `sample` and `sample'`, we can print the generated values to the terminal one by one or return a list of the randomly generated values.

```haskell
sample :: Show a => Gen a => IO ()
sample' :: Gen a => IO [a] 
```

```haskell
sample (arbitrary :: Gen Int) 
-- should produce a series of random integers, each on its own line

sample' (arbitrary :: Gen Int) 
-- it should produce a list of random integers.

sample arbitrary 
-- it should produce a series of empty tuples, ()
```
