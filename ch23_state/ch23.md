# State newtype

Captures the idea of a value that can potentially change with each computation. 

Useful for when we want to express a value that can potentially change at each step of our program and that can be read and modified without any specific constraints on how it is used.

```haskell
newtype State s a =
  State { runState :: s -> (a, s) }
```

The State data constructor takes some state as input and returns it along with some output value.

```haskell
f :: s -> (a, s)
State f :: (a, s) -> (a', (a, s)) 
State (State f) :: (a', (a, s)) -> (a'', (a', (a, s)))
```

### Isomorphisms 

The Sum newtype is isomorphic

```haskell
type Iso a b = (a -> b, b -> a)
newtype Sum a = Sum { getSum :: a }

isIsomorphic :: Iso a (Sum a)
isIsomorphic = (Sum, getSum)
```

The State newtype is also isomorphic

```haskell
isIsomorphic :: Iso (s -> (a, s)) (State s a)    
isIsomorphic = (State, runState)
```

### Examples

Consider 'random' and 'randomR' from System.Random package

```haskell
random :: (Random a) => StdGen -> (a, StdGen)
randomR :: (RandomGen g) => (a, a) -> g -> (a, g) 
State { runState :: s -> (a, s) }
```

More exercises on the State newtype.

```haskell
get :: Monad m => StateT s m s
put :: Monad m => s -> StateT s m ()
runStateT :: StateT s m a -> s -> m (a, s)

-- Examples to work through

runStateT (put 7) 7
runStateT get 7 
runStateT (put 0 >> get) 8
-- n.b. 'put 0' ensures that 1 is what's passed as state to 'get' instead of the argument '8'.
(runStateT $ put 0 >> get) 0
(runStateT $ put 1 >> get) 421357123589
(runStateT $ put 1 >> return 9001) 0
-- Here 'return' is the identity for the StateT monad and the value for 'a' in 'StateT s m a' is '9000'. Again, 'put 2' ensures that '2' is passed to 'return 9001' instead of '0'.
