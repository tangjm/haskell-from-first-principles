# Folds

Catamorphisms break down structure.

Folds are a particular case of catamorphisms that apply to lists - they break down or 'reduce' lists. With respect to folds, catamorphisms generalise folds to arbitrary data types.

Folds are higher-order functions that when given a recursive data structure, starting value and a function for accumulating the results, returns the built up value.

Fold right

A standard recursion operator that encapsulates a common pattern of recursion for processing lists.

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f acc [] = acc
foldr f acc (x : xs) = f x (foldr f acc xs)
```
```haskell
f x (f x' (f x'' (f x''' acc)))

(a -> (a -> (a -> (a -> b -> b))))
```

```haskell
foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl f acc [] = acc
foldl f acc (x : xs) = foldl f (f acc x) xs
```

```haskell
f (f (f (f acc x) x') x'') x'''
```

n.b. the accumulator is always the second argument for foldr whereas it's always the first argument for foldl. The return type is the same type as the accumulator. Because foldl is tail recursive, it is spine-strict.

Write a function that filters for DbDate values and returns a list of the UTCTime values inside them.

```haskell

Scans

```haskell

scanl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]
scanl f z [] = z : []
scanl f z (l : ls) = z : scanl f (f z l) ls

-- alternatively,
scanl f z ls = z : (case ls of 
                      [] -> []
                      (x : xs) -> scanl f (f z x) xs)
```

Example going through how we evaluate scanl

```haskell
scanl (+) 0 [1, 2, 3] = 0 : scanl (+) ((+) 0 1) [2, 3]
                      = 0 : ((+) 0 1) : scanl (+) ((+) ((+) 0 1) 2) [3]
                      = 0 : ((+) 0 1) : ((+) ((+) 0 1) 2) : ((+) ((+) ((+) 0 1) 2) 3) : []
                      = 0 : ((+) 0 1) : ((+) ((+) 0 1) 2) : 6 : []
                      = 0 : ((+) 0 1) : 3 : 6 : []
                      = 0 : 1 : 3 : 6 : []
                      = 0 : 1 : 3 : [6]
                      = 0 : 1 : [3, 6]
                      = 0 : [1, 3, 6]
                      = [0, 1, 3, 6]
```

Fibonacci numbers in terms of scanl
```haskell
fibs = 1 : scanl (+) 1 fibs

-- How does this generate an infinite list of fibonacci numbers?
fibs = 1 : (scanl (+) 1 fibs)
     = 1 : (1 : scanl (+) ((+) 1 1) (scanl (+) 1 fibs))
     = 1 : (1 : (((+) 1 1) : scanl (+) ((+) ((+) 1 1) 1) (scanl (+) ((+) 1 1) (scanl (+) 1 fibs))))
     = 1 : (1 : (((+) 1 1) : (((+) ((+) 1 1) 1) : scanl (+) ((+) ((+) ((+) 1 1) 1) ((+) 1 1)) (scanl (+) ((+) ((+) 1 1) 1) (scanl (+) ((+) 1 1) (scanl (+) 1 fibs))))))
     = ...

Try to write the factorial function from Recursion as a scan.
Youâ€™ll want scanl again, and your start value will be 1. Warning:
this will also generate an infinite list, so you may want to pass it
through a take function or similar.

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

fact :: [Integer]
fact = 1 : scanl (*) 1 fact 


-- factotorial
1 : (1 * 2) : (1 * 2 * 3) : (1 * 2 * 3 * 4) ...
1 : 2 : 6 : 24 : 120 : 720 ...

fact = 1 : scanl f z fact
     = 1 : z : scanl f (f z 1) (scanl f z fact)
     = 1 : z : (f z 1) : scanl f (f (f z 1) z) (scanl f (f z 1) (scanl f z fact))


fact :: Integral a => [a]
fact = 1 : scanl (\x y -> x * ((+1) $ div x y)) 1 fact
```

The function f should do the following:
multiply the current value by the successor of the result of dividing the the accumulator by the precedessor.

```haskell
f :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
f acc y = acc * ((+1) $ div acc y)
```
