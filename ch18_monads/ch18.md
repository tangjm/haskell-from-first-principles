# Monads

The Monad typeclass refers to an abstraction that involves functorially applying a function that produces yet more structure and then using `join` to reduce the resulting nested structure.

Monads are a special kind of applicative.

They have something special that means we can't reduce them to either applicatives or functors.

```haskell
(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b 
(>>) :: Monad m => m a -> m b -> m b
return :: Monad m => a -> m a

fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 

-- Examples
fmap (+1) [1..3]
[1..3] >>= return . (+1)

xs >>= return . f 

return . f :: a -> m b
xs :: m a 
xs >>= return . f :: m b

```

What makes Monad different from applicatives and functors is that it can alter structure, by reducing nested structure and generalising list concatenation for many data types.

Think of this `join` operator as a big union. 
$$\bigcup x$$

```haskell
join :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a
```

```haskell
bind :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
bind f xs = join $ fmap f xs 
```

We can think of (>>=) in terms of `join` after an `fmap`.

### Monad laws

Left identity

```haskell
m >>= return == m
```

Right identity

```haskell
return x >>= f = f x
```


Associativity

```haskell
(m >>= f) >>= g = m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)
```

### Kleisli composition

```haskell
(>=>)    :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> (a -> m c)
```

Note that the (>=>) is pointing from left to right, indicating that we apply the function passed as left operand first followed by the function passed as right operand.

Let's you combine two functions that return Monads, $f$ and $g$ into $g \circ f$ or $ g(f(x)) $.

cf. `(.)` which composes two functions $f$ and $g$ into $f \circ g$ or $ f(g(x)) $

```haskell 
(.)      :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
flip (.) :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)
```

A monadic function generates more structure after having been lifted over monadic structure.
