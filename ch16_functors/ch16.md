# Functors 

In category theory, a functor is a mapping between categories.

In Haskell, Functors are a typeclass for types that can be mapped over.

This lets us generalise the notion of function application or mapping over abstract structures. More specifically, we can extract out the notion of a mapping and turning it into an abstract function that can be implemented or defined in different ways for different mappable types.

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

'fmap' lets you map a function over the terms contained in a data type without altering the data type's structure.

'fmap' must satisfy two properties.

Law of identity

```haskell
fmap id == id
```

Law of composition

```haskell
fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g
```

The infix alias for 'fmap' is '<$>'

Composition of 'fmap'

```haskell
fmap :: Functor f => (m -> n) -> f m -> f n
fmap :: Functor g => (x -> y) -> g x -> g y

fmap . fmap :: (Functor f, Functor g) => 
               (m -> n) -> (f m -> f n) -> 
               (x -> y) -> (g x -> g y) -> 
               (m -> n) -> g (f m) -> g (f n)
-- How does this work?
-- Revisit this later

fmap . fmap :: (Functor f1, Functor f2) => (a -> b) -> f1 (f2 a) -> f1 (f2 b)
```

With higher-kinded types or type constructors with arity > 1, we partially apply them until they become an unary type constructor. And we then define an instance of the Functor typeclass for the resulting unary type constructor.

Natural transformations

Transforms a functor into another functor altering the structure but keeping the term level values unchanged.

A first pass

```haskell
nat :: (f a -> g a) -> f a -> g a
```

The 'Nat' type

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

type Nat f g =  forall a . f a -> g a
```

This lets us make transformations between types that both have instances of Functor.

E.g. We can transform a Maybe into a [].
