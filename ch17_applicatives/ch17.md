# Applicatives

Applicatives are monoidal functors.

A functor with application, providing operations to embed pure expressions (pure), and sequence computations and combine their results (<*> and liftA2).

```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure  :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

Properties that Applicatives must satisfy:

Identity

```haskell
pure id <*> v = v
```

Composition

```haskell
pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w)
```

Homomorphism

```haskell
pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)
```

Interchange

```haskell
u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u
```

n.b. ($ 2) produces a context in which 2 is awaiting to be applied by some unary function. 

```haskell
($ 2) :: Num a => (a -> b) -> b
```
