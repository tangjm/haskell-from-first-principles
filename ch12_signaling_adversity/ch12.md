# Signaling adversity

Maybe and Either are two data types useful for error handling.

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing
						 | Just a

data Either a b = Left a
								| Right b
```

#### String processing (pp.464 - 465)

Counting the number of instances of 'the' followed by a word beginning with a vowel.

We take the first consecutive sequence of non-whitespace characters and test to see they equal 'the'. 
If so, we see if the next word begins with a vowel
  If so, we add 1 to our count
  If not, do nothing
If not, do nothing
We move onto the next word (consecutive sequence of non-whitespace characters)
Repeat until we have a singleton list, namely, (_ : []).
Return the count at that point. 


Alternatively,
We first split our text/string into a list of strings: String -> [String]
Then we fold over our list of strings, simultaneously building up our sentence and keeping count of the number of "the" followed by a vowel prefixed word. 
Finally, we return the second element of the ordered pair returned from our fold result.

```haskell
let f = foldr (\x (ys, count) -> case notThe x == Nothing 
		      && head ys `elem` "aeiou" of 
			True -> (x ++ ys, count + 1)
			False -> (x ++ ys, count)
				) ([], 0) xs
```
