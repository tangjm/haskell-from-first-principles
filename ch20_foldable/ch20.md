# Foldable

The Foldable typeclass generalises catamorphisms (reducing or breaking down a data structure) to different datatypes. Exactly how the catamorphism is defined will depend on the underlying monoid of the Foldable.

```haskell
import Data.Foldable

fold :: (Foldable t, Monoid m) => t m -> m
foldMap :: (Foldable t, Monoid m) => (a -> m) -> t a -> m
foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
```

### `fold`

Reduces a foldable of monoids using `mappend`.

### `foldMap` 

Maps a given foldable to a foldable of monoids and then applies `fold` to reduce them to a monoid.

### Examples

```haskell
foldMap Sum [1, 2, 3, 4]
-- Sum {getSum = 10}

foldMap (*5) [1, 2, 3 :: Product Integer]
-- Product {getProduct = 750}

foldMap (*5) [1, 2, 3 :: Sum Integer]
-- Sum {getSum = 30}
```

Unlike `foldMap`, `foldr` has the monoid baked into the function that will be folded.

The following two `foldr` use the same binary associative function defined for the monoid implicit in (*), namely, the set of integers under multiplicaiton.

```haskell
foldr (*) 3 [1, 2, 3 :: Sum Integer]
-- (Sum 1 * (Sum 2 * (3 * Sum 3)))
-- Sum {getSum = 18}

foldr (*) 3 [1, 2, 3 :: Product Integer]
-- (Product 1 * (Product 2 * (3 * Product 3)))
-- Product {getProduct = 18}
```

When folding over a foldable with a single value, explicit monoid instance declarations do not affect the binary associative function as there is nothing to apply `mappend` to.

```haskell
foldMap (*2) (Just 2) :: Product Integer
-- Product (getProduct = 4)
```

Folding over a an empty foldable will return the `mempty` or identity for the declared monoid.

```haskell
foldMap (*2) Nothing :: Sum Integer
-- Sum {getSum = 0}

foldMap (+23) Nothing :: Product Integer
-- Product {getProduct = 1}
```
